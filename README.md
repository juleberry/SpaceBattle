# SpaceBattle
#### Text-based game (played in the Developer Tools Console)
This game was created as part of my cohort in Per Scholas' software engineering program.

### "Greetings! Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS CRYSTAL on a mission to destroy every last alien ship."
